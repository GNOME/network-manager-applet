Overview of changes since network-manager-applet-0.9.8.8
=========================================================

This is a new stable release of network-manager-applet.  Notable changes include:

  lookup to not use the system CA store by default, since this turns
  out to be a bad default.
* Fixed the applet to not show the PIN unlock dialog even if the PIN was
  saved in the keyring.
* We no longer try to build the bluetooth widget when using newer
  versions of gnome-bluetooth (that no longer support plugins)
* Fixed a GSettings-related warning when using GLib 2.40
* Updated translations
